Part-of-speech-(PoS)-Tagging
This is a group project that have been done as an assignment for the course of Natural Language Understanding. In this assignment we implemented a neural PoS sequence labeling model to label the words of a given sentence. More particularly, we implemented a neural model based on long short-term memory networks (LSTMs)</br>
For this two models were implemented: the first one takes as input the words-level embeddings. The second one takes in addition the characters-level embeddings that was computed through a character-level LSTM.
